# cheese-simple-boilerplate
This is a boilerplate for a simple [cheese](http://npmjs.org/package/cheese) app. It is meant to be cloned with [bp](http://github.com/code-boilerplates/bp).

## Cloning it
You *can* `git clone` it, but it would be much easier to clone this boilerplate with [bp](http://github.com/code-boilerplates/bp). Once you've installed bp, clone the boilerplate like this:

```sh
$ bp code-boilerplates/cheese-simple-boilerplate my-awesome-app
```

(Replace `my-awesome-app` with the name of your app/project.)

You're now good to go!

## Running it
This is just one step:

```sh
$ run [<port>]
```

The `run` script just performs an `npm install` if it needs to, and then starts a cheese server.

(Replace `[<port>]` with whatever port you want to start the server on. If you haven't specified, the server will listen on port 3000.)
